Singaporean youth come up tops when it comes to enjoying a high quality of life while being able to tap on some of the best opportunities the country has to offer.

But there remains a small group of youth who, because of their circumstances or family backgrounds, are not able to make the most of the opportunities at hand.

Referred to as “Youths-at-Risk” (or "at risk youths"), they are identified based on recurring behavioural patterns. In Singapore, this group are youths aged between 12 to 35 years old who exhibit traits which include:

>* Conduct issues;
> * Peer or family relationship issues;
> * Bullying (bully or victim);
> * Social difficulties;
> * Anti-social attitudes or behaviours;
> * Dependence/addiction to cyber activities, drinking, sexual activities, substances etc;
> * Incarceration of parents or significant care-giver;
> * Criminal conduct; and/or 
> * Poor response to school intervention;

We have worked with social service organisations, grassroots groups and other government agencies to reach out to these youths-at-risk. 

For instance, in our prosocial football initiative Saturday Night Lights, we focus on youth in secondary school and tertiary institutions who exhibit signs of wayward behaviour like smoking, petty theft and truancy. For many of these vulnerable youth, being part of a sports programme like Saturday Night Light means gaining the support and life skills necessary in order for them to get their life back on track.
