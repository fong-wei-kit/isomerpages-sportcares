#### At SportCares, we are set apart by sport.

At SportCares, we believe that sport is the way for us to change the lives of those we serve.

We use sports to empower the vulnerable - recognising the different aspirations, strengths, and abilities of youths at-risk.

We use sports to make diversity positive - inspiring persons with disabilities to fulfil their potential and lead meaningful lives.

We use sports to activate a community of care - celebrating achievements that showcase acts of kindness, compassion and empathy as we address social issues together.

Multiply this effect, and you get greater people, a greater society, and a greater nation.

So great sports programming is only the beginning - our way to make an impact on one local community after another.

You can support SportCares by volunteering your time, playing on our team or donating through Giving.SG. (All donations to SportCares above $10 will generate a tax credit of 2.5 times the original amount for the donor.)

Equally important, if you know someone or a group that could do with a helping hand from SportCares, please reach out to us through sportcares@sport.gov.sg
