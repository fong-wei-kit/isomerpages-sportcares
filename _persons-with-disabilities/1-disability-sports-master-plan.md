#### Welcome to inclusivesport.sg 
Since 2016, SportCares, under the umbrella of ActiveSG, has been administering the recommendations of the Disability Sports Master Plan (DSMP) under the guidance of the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth [MCCY](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sector/initiatives/disability-sports-master-plan). The broad outcomes of the DSMP are: 

* Expand access and opportunities for sports participation by PwDs
* Develop organisational and professional capabilities in disability sports 
* Build public awareness of disability sports and strengthen affinity with our Team Singapore athletes

We are constantly working to increase accessibility in our sports centres and to provide more opportunities for persons with disabilities to live better through sport.
