### Welcome to InclusiveSport.sg
Since 2016, SportCares, under the umbrella of ActiveSG, has been executing the recommendations of the Disability Sports Master Plan (DSMP) under the guidance of the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth [MCCY](https://www.mccy.gov.sg/sector/initiatives/disability-sports-master-plan).

### DSMP Timeline
-  **January 2015**: MCCY convened an inter-agency Committee for Disability Sports to recommend ways to raise awareness of and participation in disability sports, as well as engender greater inclusiveness and understanding of persons with disabilities (PwDs) through disability sports. The committee was chaired by then Minister of State (Prime Minister’s Office & MCCY) Mr Sam Tan, and comprised partner agencies from the people, private and public sector.-
- The committee also engaged in public consultation with PwDs, caregivers, teachers, administrators, and Singapore Disability Sports Council, Special Olympics Singapore and the Deaf Sports Association – the three main national disability sports associations providing sports programmes for PwDs.
- **December 2015**: Singapore hosted the ASEAN Para Games for the first time, generating public awareness about disability sports at an unprecedented scale. The event demonstrated how sport can be a means to foster inclusive and accessible communities.
