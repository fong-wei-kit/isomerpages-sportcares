#### Dear Open Session Participants, kindly note that some Play-Ability sessions are currently on hold as a precautionary measure due to the recent COVID-19 outbreak. We will update this page once the sessions resume. Thank you and stay healthy!

(24/3/2020) Sport Singapore (SportSG) will be suspending all of ActiveSGâ€™s children and youth-centric organised programmes at ActiveSG facilities with immediate effect until 7 Apr 2020 to coincide with efforts by schools to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19.  The make-up programme sessions will be held after the suspension is lifted.

The affected children and youth-centric programmes include the following:

* ActiveSG Academies and Clubs programmes
* Swim Safer assessment
* Learn-To-Play programmes at ActiveSG Sport Centres
* SportCares programmes

SportSG would like to advise all private academies and clubs, as well as our partners to follow suit to protect our young ones.  Despite the inconveniences caused, we seek the cooperation of our partners and parents during this period to remain committed to work together with us to keep our children safe.
