#### Play-Ability Sports Buddy

Play-Ability is a programme that provides recreational sports opportunities for persons with disabilities. These sessions allow PWDs to have access to community sports venues, stay active, and socialise through sport.

We are looking for regular sports buddies to serve as befrienders to beneficiaries of the programme. 

You don't need to be an athlete or a sports specialist to volunteer. All you need is a positive attitude! 

As a Sports Buddy, you will:

* Assist the badminton coach to set up and clean up the field of play
* Assist, interact and and play with the participants
* Assist the coaches with activity demonstration if needed
* Most importantly, put a smile on someone's face!
