### For our programmes to be truly successful, we believe in working with and alongside the larger community. 

We execute our vision through a model called the Communities of Care, an approach which relies on a network of volunteer welfare organisations, government agencies, corporate partners and the sports fraternity.

Communities of Care aims to bring these partners together, equip them with the right tools, harness their collective energies and channel these forces for good.

By tapping on the abilities of both sports and non-sports related partners, we provide comprehensive and holistic experiences for our beneficiaries. 

Our on-the-ground efforts help us get to the heart of the community and identify issues that require attention. 

Using this knowledge, we then work alongside our partners to help address the issues and develop solutions with sports at the heart of these efforts.

At the same time, we also place a strong emphasis on the growth and empowerment of stakeholders both within and outside of the SportCares organisation. For instance, we provide regular training for coaches so that they are up-to-date with the latest developments in the sporting landscape. 

Above all, the Communities of Care model champions the human spirit by bringing together different groups of people from varied walks of life together as one.
